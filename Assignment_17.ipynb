It is a type of regression analysis that is based on the logistic function, which is an S-shaped curve that maps any real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1.\n",

    "The logistic regression model is a linear model that uses one or more independent variables to predict the probability of a binary outcome. The model takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))\n",

    "where p is the predicted probability of the binary outcome (i.e., the probability that the outcome will be \"1\"), z is a linear combination of the independent variables, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n",

    "The logistic regression model estimates the coefficients (i.e., the weights) of the independent variables that maximize the likelihood of observing the given binary outcomes. This is done using a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm.\n",

    "Evaluate the likelihood function at the estimated parameters: Finally, we evaluate the likelihood function at the estimated parameters to get the maximum value of the likelihood function. This gives us the maximum likelihood estimate of the model.\n",

    "In logistic regression, maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the parameters of the model. The likelihood function for logistic regression is derived from the logistic distribution, which is a probability distribution that describes the relationship between a binary response variable and one or more predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the predictor variables and the log odds of the response variable should be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the data set should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "No outliers: The data set should not contain outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large sample size: The sample size should be large enough to ensure that the maximum likelihood estimates are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, maximum likelihood estimation is a powerful method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model based on observed data. It is widely used in logistic regression and other statistical modeling techniques. The assumptions of the model should be carefully evaluated before using maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the parameters."
